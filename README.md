Laptop-Request-Catalog-Item

This project automates the laptop request and provisioning process through a self-service catalog item integrated with the IT Service Management (ITSM) platform. It enables employees to submit laptop requests with predefined models, specifications, and business justifications, triggering automated approval and fulfillment workflows.

The solution enhances efficiency, transparency, and compliance by streamlining asset allocation, tracking inventory in real-time, and maintaining audit-ready records. It supports role-based approvals, SLA monitoring, and integration with asset management systems for faster provisioning and improved IT governance
